            2023 – Lightness of Being  – Ibrahim's Khan Gallery – Cyprus
The theme of the exhibition, "Lightness of Being," embodies the light and airy nature of life, exploring the simplicity and beauty hidden in every moment of our existence. This theme encourages a deeper appreciation for the delicate, often overlooked aspects of our daily lives. Over the course of two months, eight talented Erasmus artists from Finland and Estonia delved into this concept, working passionately with various materials and methods such as painting, photography, printmaking, mixed media, and more. Their creations offer a rich tapestry of expressive means.
Each artwork presented carries the essence of Cyprus and encapsulates the unique experiences of the artists, making this exhibition a journey into the world of art that reflects their vivid impressions and thoughts during their creative process. "Lightness of Being" invites viewers to connect with the ethereal and transient moments that define our human experience.

                2023 – Slice of Life – House of Literature & Arts Paphos – Cyprus
            </p><br>
        ‘’Slice of life is a depiction of mundane experiences in art and entertainment. In theater, slice of life refers to naturalism, while in literary parlance it is a narrative technique in which a seemingly arbitrary sequence of events in a character's life is presented, often lacking plot development, conflict, and exposition, as well as often having an open ending.
In literary parlance, the term "slice of life" refers to a storytelling technique that presents a seemingly arbitrary sample of a character's life, which often lacks a coherent plot, conflict, or ending. A work that focuses on a minute and faithful reproduction of some bit of reality, without selection, organization, or judgment, and where every small detail is presented with scientific fidelity, is an example of the "slice of life."’

                2022 – Freeze the Moment – Ibrahim's Khan Gallery – Cyprus
            </p><br>
        Freezing the moment means, for an instant, withdrawing from the present. 
Briefly moving from within what is happening to the viewpoint of looking in. It means memorizing your surroundings.
Artists and photographers often attempt to use the element of time and memory. It is an electrifying image of the artist in the concentrated act of catching and freezing a moment in time: "The painter takes on her role and in doing so claims for himself her dark powers of enchantment… Her magic is his magic, a petrifying art." (Caravaggio)
